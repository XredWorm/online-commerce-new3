                Kazakhstan is a country in the middle of Eurasia. Its official name is the Republic of Kazakhstan.
                Kazakhstan is the
                ninth biggest country in the world, and it is also the biggest landlocked country in the world. Before
                the end of the
                Soviet Union, it was called "Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic". The president of the country from 1991
                through March
                2019 was Nursultan Nazarbayev. Astana is the capital city of Kazakhstan. Almaty was the capital until
                1998, when it
                moved to Astana.
                The Kazakh language, which is a Turkic language, is the native language, but Russian has equal official
                status for all
                administrative and institutional purposes. Islam is the largest religion- about 70% of the population
                are Muslims,
                with Christianity practiced by 26% Russia leases (rents) the land for the Baikonur Cosmodrome (site
                of Russian
                spacecraft launches) from Kazakhstan.
                Kazakhstan is a transcontinental country mostly in Asia with a small western part across the Ural River
                in Europe. It
                has borders with the Russian Federation in the north and west, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan
                in the southwest,
                and China in the far east. The northern border is mostly with Siberia, Russia, so Russia has the longest
                border with
                Kazakhstan. Basically, Kazakhstan runs from the Caspian Sea in the west to the mainly Muslim Chinese
                autonomous
                region of Xinjiang. Kazakhstan has no ocean shoreline, but borders the Caspian Sea, which boats use to
                get to
                neighboring countries. The Caspian Sea is an Endorheic basin without connections to any ocean.
